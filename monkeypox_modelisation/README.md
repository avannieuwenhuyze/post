## Abstract

Monkeypox is a disease that has been on the rise again across several continents in recent months.(Aout 2022)

This notebook allows you to :
- Visualize the development of the actual disease (2022)  
- Modeling an epidemic with SIR model
- Use the Euler method to create a SIR model
- Use SciPy to create a SIR model
- Understand an SVEIR Model
- Visualize the impact of the use of a vaccine on this disease with the help of mathematical modeling
- Make a tool for epidemic interactive modeling

The modeling work of the Monkeypox disease is based on the scientific publication of
> Usman, S. and
Adamu, I.I. (2017) Modeling the Transmission Dynamics of the Monkeypox Virus
Infection with Treatment and Vaccination
Interventions. Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics, 5, 2335-2353.
